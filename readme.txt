you could either run quora_c.c in windows or unix-based system.
i read inputs from input.txt, newline seperates every test cases.. 
feel free to add more testcases to test my program.
my computer solve the samples in 12 seconds.


IN WINDOWS.
NOTE: ONLY release mode can achieve 12 seconds to solve puzzle.
you need to set enviroment path of visual studio 2010..as shown in the picture.
and double click compile.bat and then double click run.bat
result is output.txt

IN UNIX.
make
./quora
